# Jira Assistant Chatbot

[![CI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml)
[![Integration Tests](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project/actions/workflows/integration-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project/actions/workflows/integration-tests.yml)

A LangGraph-powered agent that can search for Jira issues in a mock database through a natural language interface.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a conversational AI assistant built with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) that interacts with a mock Jira database. Users can ask questions about Jira issues in natural language, and the assistant will convert those questions into appropriate queries and return formatted results.

### Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions about Jira issues using everyday language
- **Mock Jira Database**: Demonstrates integration with Jira without requiring actual credentials
- **Streamlit UI**: Simple, interactive chat interface for easy interaction
- **LangGraph Workflow**: Visualize the agent's decision-making process in LangGraph Studio

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for the language model)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langgraph-jira-assistant.git
cd langgraph-jira-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## Running the Application

### Streamlit Interface

Run the Streamlit application to interact with the agent through a chat interface:

```bash
cd src/agent/ui
streamlit run app.py
```

The chat interface will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

### LangGraph Studio

To visualize and debug the agent's workflow:

1. Start the LangGraph server:
```bash
langgraph dev
```

2. Open the LangGraph Studio UI at http://localhost:3000.

```

## Usage Examples

You can ask the assistant questions like:

- "Show me all issues in project PROJ"
- "What are the in-progress tasks in the WEB project?"
- "List all completed issues across all projects"
- "Show me details about PROJ-2"

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Extend the mock database**: Add more mock projects and issues in `src/agent/database/jira.py`
2. **Enhance the agent capabilities**: Modify `src/agent/graph/graph.py` to add new tools or reasoning steps
3. **Improve the UI**: Extend the Streamlit interface in `src/agent/ui/app.py`

While iterating on your graph in LangGraph Studio, you can edit past state and rerun your app from previous states to debug specific nodes. Local changes will be automatically applied via hot reload.

Follow-up requests extend the same thread. You can create an entirely new thread, clearing previous history, using the `+` button in the top right.

For more advanced features and examples, refer to the [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). These resources can help you adapt this template for your specific use case.

### Running Tests
